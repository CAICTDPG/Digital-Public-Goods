# Digital Public Goods 数字公共产品

The digital public goods database of China Academy of Information and Communications Technology(CAICT) is established by the trusted open source team of the cloud computing and big data research institute of CAICT. The database includes digital public goods that meet the DPG standards of CAICT. CAICT’s DPG Standard follows the definition of digital public goods set by the UN Secretary-General in the [2020 Roadmap for Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/): *digital public goods must be open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).* Our standard is based on the [DPG standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) of the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) (DPGA) and defines six capability dimensions.

中国信通院数字公共产品数据库是由中国信通院云计算与大数据研究所可信开源团队建立。数据库收录了符合中国信通院数字公共产品标准的数字公共产品。中国信通院数字公共产品标准认可联合国在[2020年数字合作路线图](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/)中设定的数字公共产品定义：*数字公共产品必须是开源的遵守隐私和其他适用法律和最佳实践的软件、开放数据、开放人工智能模型、开放标准和开放内容，不会造成伤害，并有助于实现可持续发展目标 (SDG)。*我们的标准在[数字公共产品联盟](https://digitalpublicgoods.net)的[数字公共产品标准](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/)的基础上，定义为了六个能力维度。

## 📃 DPG Standard of CAICT 中国信通院数字公共产品标准

CAICT DPG Standard defines the capabilities that digital public goods should have, which are divided into six dimensions, including **non-competitive & non-exclusive, interoperability, security, credibility, scalability, and sustainability**. The digital public goods capability framework is shown in the figure below.

**1. Non-compete & non-exclusive**
Non-competitive & non-exclusive requires that digital public goods do not exclude anyone from consumption in different application scenarios, and at the same time require that there is no conflict of interest between users. It includes open and transparent capabilities, infrastructure improvement capabilities, and user usage capabilities.
**2. Scalability**
Scalability requires that digital public goods have the ability to add new product functions and modify original functions, including product iteration capabilities, quality management capabilities, demand management capabilities, and branch management capabilities.
**3. Interoperability**
Interoperability refers to the operation and information-sharing capabilities that digital public goods should have in different computer systems, networks, and other environments, including product compatibility, dependency management capabilities, and completeness of auxiliary documents.
**4. Security**
Security refers to the security benchmarks that digital public goods should meet, including security assurance capabilities, vulnerability repair capabilities, harmless disposal capabilities, and data extraction capabilities.
**5. Credibility**
Credibility means that digital public goods ensure the trust of users through the protection of users' privacy, rights and interests, and compliance. It includes the ability to protect independent ownership, privacy protection, and compliance with local laws.
**6. Sustainability**
Sustainability requires that digital public goods meet the goals of sustainable development, including digital development normative capabilities and sustainable development capabilities.
